Routine (the behavior itself; the action you take)  \\n3. Reward (the benefit you gain from doing the behavior)  \\n \\nThis sequence has been proven over and over again by behavioral psychology \\nresearchers.

And \\nmore recently, I read about it in Charles Duhigg’s best–selling book, The Power of \\nHabit.  \\n \\n(Duhigg’s book refers to the three steps as cue, routine, reward.

       "  Document(page_content=\"The Idea in Practice \\n  \\nMost of the time, I try to be a practitioner of my ideas and not just someone who \\nshares their opinion, so allow me to explain this strategy by using two real \\nexamples from my own life.  \\n \\n \\nExample 1: Writing  \\n \\nI publish a new article every Monday and Thursday. Since my first article on \\nNovember 12, 2012, I’ve been delivering two articles per week, every week. \\nSometimes the article is shorter than expected, sometimes it’s not as compelling \\nas I had hoped, and sometimes it’s not as useful as it could be … but it gets out to \\nthe world nonetheless.  \\n \\nOf course, I didn't always operate on a Monday-Thursday schedule. In fact, I came \\nup with reasons for actively avoiding a schedule. I told myself, “I do my best \\nwriting when I'm inspired, so I'll just wait until I get the urge to write.”  \\n \\nI assumed that if I wasn't doing my best work, then I shouldn't be doing it at all. \\nThe problem with that strategy is that my output was erratic at best.  \\n \\nIt took me awhile to realize it, but it's not about always doing your best work, it's \\nabout doing the best you can on a consistent basis.  \\n \\nOnce I stopped focusing on results and simply held myself to a consistent \\nschedule, my work and my output improved. In the first 6 months after I started \\nwriting two times per week, I wrote more in quantity and better in quality than in \\nthe previous two years.  \\n \\n \\nJamesClear.com Page 27\", metadata={'source': './james-clear-transform-your-habits-v3.pdf', 'page': 27}),\n",
